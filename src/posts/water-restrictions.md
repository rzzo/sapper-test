WHEREAS, Section 13-1-160(a) of the Wellington Municipal Code concerning sprinkling and water scarcity states the Town Board shall have the authority to establish such rules and regulations so as to limit the days of outdoor watering or sprinkling or to limit the use of water in such manner as it shall deem necessary. Such regulations may be adopted by Resolution and shall become effective immediately upon passage.; and

WHEREAS, drinking water demand has increased significantly, due in part to COVID-19 factors such as the stay-at-home requirements.

WHEREAS, up to 75% of water is lost through evaporation when watering is done during the heat of the day.

WHEREAS, the Town has maintained in place outdoor watering restrictions since 2013 as adopted by Resolution 8-2013.

WHEREAS, water use has become a more pervasive problem for the Town and water delivery costs have risen dramatically and supply capacity has become more limited as a result of increased burdens on the Town’s water treatment plant.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Trustees of the Town of Wellington, Colorado, that:

SECTION 1: Mandatory Restrictions.

Effectively immediately upon passage, outdoor watering within the Town of Wellington using treated water supplies from the Town’s Water Utility shall be limited as follows:

1. Between May and October 15, 2020, outdoor watering shall be restricted to the hours between 8:00 p.m. in the evening and 8:00 a.m. the next morning.

2. Addresses with odd street numbers shall only water on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

3. Addresses with even street numbers shall only water on Wednesdays and Sundays.

4. Runoff from irrigation shall be kept to an insignificant minimum.

5. Irrigation overspray onto non-vegetated areas is prohibited.

6. Washing of outside paved or concrete areas is prohibited.

If water production falls below levels required to provide water demand or the Town Administrator and Town Engineer determine that water supplies are in jeopardy of not been able to meet demands, the Town Administrator and Town Engineer may order that outside watering with domestic water supplies be reduced to one day a week and such order may provide for established watering days based on addresses.

SECTION 2.: Water Wells

If outdoor watering using adjudicated water wells ("Non-Utility Watering") occurs, the well owner shall at all times when water is being applied conspicuously post the property as being watered using "well water" or "non-potable water."

SECTION 3: Voluntary Restrictions.

Residents applying utility and non-utility water are encouraged to follow the following voluntary restrictions to conserve water and reduce the potential for more stringent mandatory restrictions.

1. Non-utility users limit outdoor watering to no more than 2 days a week.

2. After rainstorms, turn off automatic watering systems until lawns start to get dry again.

3. Watering should be limited to only that which is necessary to keep lawns

and other landscape plans alive and healthy.

4. Non-utility sprinkler systems should be maintained and adjusted to prevent water running off the lawn and into the street gutter.

5. If cars are washed outdoors at home, washing should be done with buckets and rinsed by hose with a spray nozzle. Avoid letting water run.

SECTION 4: VIOLATIONS:

As provided by the Wellington Municipal Code at 13-1-160(a), Enforcement shall be by summons issued in accordance with Section 2-4-140 of the Code. The property of any User violating this provision shall be subject to utility service termination. Penalties may be enforced against the occupant or owner of any property o any person responsible for violating watering restrictions. Each day that such violation continues to exist shall be considered a separate offense. Violation of watering restrictions as provided for by this resolution shall be a non-criminal violation and pursuant to Wellington Municipal Code Section 1-4-20, any person convicted of a noncriminal violation may, after receiving a prior written, verbal or posted warning, be fined by an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). In addition, such person shall pay all costs and expenses in the case, including attorney fees.
