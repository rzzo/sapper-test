Before we start tonight’s meeting, I would like to thank Town Staff, first responders, health care professionals, board of trustees and community members who have stepped up to help our neighbors in need.

Before we start tonight’s meeting, I would like to thank Town Staff, first responders, health care professionals, board of trustees and community members who have stepped up to help our neighbors in need. In the last 48-hours we have seen a lot of changes with respect to COVID-19 protocol, and we will see more in the coming days ahead.

As we move forward, please understand the steps that we take are to protect the health of our most vulnerable community members and provide essential services. The Town is actively working with our partner agencies at the local and county level to ensure we are addressing the needs of all residents and business owners. Because conditions are changing daily, we ask for your patience while we work to get accurate information out to the public.

I encourage you to follow the Town and Fire District on their social media pages for any information regarding the community’s response to COVID-19 and updated information from our partners at Larimer County Department of Health and Environment.

While, there is a lot of uncertainty right now, I know that if we stick together and support each other, we can honor our Wellington values and will be stronger because of it.

Thank you

Troy Smith\
Mayor
